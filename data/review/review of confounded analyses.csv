Four one-sample t-tests confirmed that the Similar-Positive trial type (t=.464, df = 29, p<.0001) and the Opposite-Positive trial type (t=.284, df = 29, p<.0003) were significantly different from zero, however the effects for Opposite-Negative (p =.09)andSimilar-Negative (p = .1) did not reach significance. Overall, participants showed relatively strong effects when coordinating themselves with positive targets, but not when coordinating themselves with negative targets.",5 of advance online publication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
